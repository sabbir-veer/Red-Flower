I saw a red flower
your burning eyes
keeping out all the tears 
meseems it's full of lies

can you imagine a snow ball?
droplets of warm water?
keeping away heart from a random call?

are you gonna build a verse?
remembering moments that still alive?
was that mars beholding full of curse?

I saw summer rain
every drop holds beastliest pain
downfall like heartiest slower
but never noticed cloaking red flower!!
